# Drone Flight Simulator

A Python-based simulator that models a drone‚Äôs realistic trajectory following a given flight plan.

---

## üìã Description

This project computes the path a drone would take between a series of waypoints, automatically adjusting turns using a configurable turn radius. The core of this simulator is its ability to model acceleration and deceleration based on turn curvature, producing realistic speed and position profiles throughout the flight.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- Precise turn simulation with adjustable turn radii  
- Dynamic acceleration/deceleration modeling during turns  
- Discrete output of position, velocity, and acceleration at configurable time intervals  
- Telemetry‚Äëcomparison tool: simulated vs. real  
- Validated against 50+ real drone flight paths, with a maximum time deviation of 8 seconds for flights longer than 3 minutes
